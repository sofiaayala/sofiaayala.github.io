        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>In my humble opinion, Jorge is the best residential real estate broker in the North Dallas area. He is "outstanding" and everybody that I have referred to him feels the same way! I am just glad I had Jorge working hard for us in this crazy market with little pre-owned properties available. He made a very scary situation seem workable. That was very much appreciated!<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>Jorge was simply fantastic, everything from staging our home to planning appropriate price points to guidance during the inspection. Jorge provided insightful and timely guidance. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy or sell a home. He made this process extremely easy due to his guidance and knowledge.<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

        <p><i class="fa fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>Thank you so much for making this a relatively painless experience. Jorge took us step by step as we sold and bought a new home. Many mistakes we made in the past were avoided this time because he was there to guide us. I wish we had used him for every move!! He was professional team and I would not hesitate to recommend him again.<i class="fa fa-quote-right" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>
